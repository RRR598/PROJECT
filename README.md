                                                 HR Analytics â€“ Predict Employee Attrition

Project Overview :
This project analyzes HR data to identify factors contributing to employee attrition and predicts the likelihood of future resignations. The goal is to help organizations reduce turnover and retain talent.

Objective :
Understand the key drivers of employee attrition.
Analyze patterns based on department, salary, promotion history, and work-life balance.
Build a predictive model to identify employees at risk of leaving.

Dataset:
Dataset used: Employee HR dataset containing attributes like department, job role, salary, years at company, promotion history, and attrition status.
Note: Cleaned version of the dataset is included (attrition_cleaned.csv).

Tools Used :
Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and modeling
Power BI (optional for dashboard visualization)

Steps Performed :
Data Cleaning
Handled missing and null values
Converted data types and ensured consistency
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized attrition trends by department, salary, and job role
Identified correlations between employee features and attrition
Predictive Modeling
Built classification models (Decision Tree / Logistic Regression)
Evaluated model performance with accuracy and confusion matrix
Determined feature importance
Insights & Recommendations
Higher attrition in Sales and Technical departments
Employees with lower salary increments or no promotions are more likely to leave
Long commute and poor work-life balance contribute to attrition

Recommendations: retention programs, career development, and better compensation

Deliverables :
Jupyter Notebook: Complete EDA and predictive modeling (HR_Attrition_EDA.ipynb)
Cleaned Dataset: attrition_cleaned.csv
PDF Report: HR_Attrition_Report.pdf (summary of insights and recommendations)

How to Run :
Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-link>
Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
Install required Python libraries:
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

Key Insights :
Departments like Sales and Technical have higher attrition.
Lack of promotions and low salary increments increase employee turnover.
Work-life balance and commute impact retention.
Actionable strategies can help reduce attrition and retain talent.
